# Unique Numbers Finder (x86 Assembly)

A simple x86 Assembly program that identifies two numbers in an array where all other numbers appear exactly twice.

## How it works
The program first prompts the user to enter the length of the array. Then, the user is asked to manually input the numbers, one by one. The input must include exactly two unique numbers (which appear only once), while all other numbers should appear exactly twice.
