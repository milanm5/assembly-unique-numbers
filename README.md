# Unique Numbers Finder (x86 Assembly)

A simple x86 Assembly program that identifies two integers in an array where all other integers appear exactly twice.

## How it works
The program first prompts the user to enter the length of the array. Then, the user is asked to manually input the integers, one by one. The input must include exactly two unique integers (which appear only once), while all other integers should appear exactly twice.
